## INSTALATION

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies with 
    > npm install
3. Run test with any of
    > npx hardhat test
    > npm run test

## WALKTHROUGH

    The project is intended to make swaps with Curve Finance, and is using the Stable Swap pool, but if you have problems with this pool you can change any swap you want, by changing the corresponding function, here you have an example for Uniswap. You just have to change this function




    ``` javascript
        function _swapTokensForDAI(address _tokenIn, uint256 _amountIn)
        internal {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenIn).approve(StableSwap, _amountIn);
            for(uint128 q = 1; q <= _tokensAccepted.length; q++) {
                if(_tokenIn == _tokensAccepted[q]) {
                    int128 _index = int128(q);
                    IStableSwap(StableSwap).exchange(_index, 0, _amountIn, 1);
                }
            }
    }
    ```
    For this one




    ``` javascript
        function _swapTokensForDAI(address _tokenIn, uint256 _amountIn)
        internal{
            IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenIn).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amountIn);
            IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenIn).approve(UniswapV2Router02, _amountIn);
            address[] memory _path;
            _path = new address[](2);
            _path[0] = _tokenIn;
            _path[1] = DAIaddress;
            IUniswapV2Router02(UniswapV2Router02).
                swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
                    _amountIn, 1, _path, address(this), block.timestamp + 1);
        }
    ```
    You can also change pools on Uniswap, for example 3pool. here you have the address for this one
